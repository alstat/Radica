So that using Poisson upper and lower 95% confidence limis on observed numbers of dicentrics, the 33 dicentrics based on the new data above, suggest that the lower limit is Y_L = 22.945/256 and upper limit is Y_U = 45.28/256. The values 22.945 and  45.28 are obtained from Table 8 of reference (1). And the codes below does just that with plot of dose-response curve generated above but this time overlaying the predicted dose and its predicted confidence interval which are indicated by blue point (with arrow) and dashed lines, respectively.\n```{r}\nyl_2gy <- 22.945/256\nyu_2gy <- 45.28/256\n\ndose_curve(pnri_output, yci = c(yl_2gy, yu_2gy), newdat = newdf[1,], level = .95, eta = .001)\n```\n\nFor 4Gy with overdispersed cell distribution based on the preliminary statistics obtained above, the computation for Y_L and Y_U needs some adjustment to account for this characteristics according to reference (1). Such adjustment is given by the correction factor in Equation (9) of the said refernce. So that using this correction factor, the next step is to obtain the corresponding Poisson confidence limit for the 202 dicentrics of 4Gy. Table 8 of reference (1) is insufficient as it only provides dicentrics up to 103 only, which is a portion of 300 values taken from reference (2). And based on the said reference, the confidence limit of 202 dicentric is (175.485, 230.28). And this is coded as follows:\n```{r}\nyl_4gy <- 175.485/492 * ((175.485/202)**(sqrt(newout$preliminary$disp_idx[2])))\nyu_4gy <- 230.28/492 * ((230.28/202)**(sqrt(newout$preliminary$disp_idx[2])))\ndose_curve(pnri_output, yci = c(yl_4gy, yu_4gy), newdat = newdf[2,], level = .95, eta = .001)\n```\n\nAnd as suggested in reference (1), it's a good practice to consider 83% confidence interval on the regression (dose-response) curve to reduce the possible overestimation of the uncertainty of the dose value predicted. With a little tweak from the previous code, the following provides \n```{r}\ndose_curve(pnri_output, yci = c(yl_2gy, yu_2gy), newdat = newdf[1,], level = .83, eta = .001)\ndose_curve(pnri_output, yci = c(yl_4gy, yu_4gy), newdat = newdf[2,], level = .83, eta = .001)\n```\n\n\n## References\n1.
